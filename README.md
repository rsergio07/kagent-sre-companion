# SRE Companion Demo: AI-Powered Operations with Kagent

This repository demonstrates how **Kagent** transforms traditional Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices through **AI-powered cluster operations**. Rather than showcasing perfect workflows, this demo deliberately exposes real-world challenges — incomplete metrics, rate limits, and service misconfigurations — transforming them into valuable learning opportunities for modern SRE practices.

The demonstration encompasses intelligent blue/green deployment management, autonomous failover capabilities, conversational cluster operations with AI agents, and seamless integration of monitoring, load testing, and failure simulation into cohesive operational scenarios through **hands-on scripted exercises**.

## Repository Structure and Component Architecture

The project follows a logical separation of concerns designed to showcase production-ready SRE practices while maintaining educational clarity. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the overall demonstration ecosystem.

### Application Layer (`app/`)

The **`app/`** directory contains the demonstration Flask application that serves as the target workload for all SRE operations. The **`app.py`** file implements a lightweight web service with three critical endpoints that mirror real-world application patterns. The root endpoint (`/`) renders a dynamic interface that changes color and metadata based on deployment version, providing immediate visual feedback during failover scenarios. The health endpoints (`/healthz` and `/readyz`) follow Kubernetes best practices for liveness and readiness probes, ensuring proper integration with the orchestration layer. The work endpoint (`/work`) provides configurable CPU burn functionality for load testing and scaling demonstrations.

The **`requirements.txt`** file maintains minimal dependencies (Flask and Gunicorn) to reduce complexity and potential security vulnerabilities while providing production-ready serving capabilities. The **`templates/index.html`** file creates a responsive interface that dynamically reflects the current deployment state through environment-driven theming, making blue/green transitions immediately visible to operators and stakeholders.

### Kubernetes Manifests (`k8s/`)

The **`k8s/`** directory contains the core Kubernetes resources that demonstrate production blue/green deployment patterns. The **`namespace.yaml`** isolates all demo resources within the `sre-companion-demo` namespace, following security and organizational best practices while preventing conflicts with other cluster workloads.

The **`deployment-blue.yaml`** and **`deployment-green.yaml`** files implement identical deployment specifications with environment-specific customizations. The blue deployment starts with 2 replicas and serves as the primary active environment, while the green deployment initializes with 0 replicas in standby mode. Both deployments include comprehensive resource limits and requests to enable proper autoscaling behavior, along with properly configured health probes that integrate with the application endpoints.

The **`service.yaml`** defines a NodePort service with version-specific selectors that enable traffic routing between blue and green deployments. This service configuration serves as the focal point for the autonomous failover controller, which modifies the selector labels to redirect traffic during outage scenarios.

### Autonomous Operations (`controllers/`)

The **`failover-controller.yaml`** implements a sophisticated autonomous failover system that embodies modern SRE automation principles. The controller includes comprehensive RBAC permissions for safe cluster operations, a ConfigMap containing Python-based monitoring logic, and a deployment specification that ensures high availability of the control plane itself.

The embedded monitoring script continuously evaluates service endpoint availability and automatically switches traffic routing when outages are detected. The controller creates Kubernetes events for audit trails and integrates with the broader observability stack through structured logging. This component demonstrates how AI-augmented automation can reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) while maintaining human oversight capabilities.

### AI Platform Integration (`kagent/`)

The **`kagent/`** directory contains the complete configuration for AI-powered operational capabilities. The **`modelconfig.yaml`** establishes connections to large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and OpenAI GPT-4), enabling natural language interfaces for complex operational queries and analysis.

The **`agent.yaml`** and **`failover-agent-config.yaml`** define specialized AI agents with domain-specific knowledge for SRE operations. These agents possess deep understanding of blue/green deployment patterns, failover scenarios, and Kubernetes operational best practices. The **`mcpserver.yaml`** configures Model Context Protocol servers that provide secure, controlled access to cluster resources for AI agents.

The **`memory.yaml`** and **`session.yaml`** files enable persistent context and conversation state management, allowing AI agents to maintain awareness of ongoing operations and historical decisions. The **`monitoring/values.yaml`** customizes Prometheus stack deployment with demo-specific configurations that enhance AI agent access to metrics and alerting data.

### Monitoring and Observability (`grafana/`)

The **`sre-demo-dashboard.json`** provides a comprehensive Grafana dashboard specifically designed for blue/green deployment monitoring. The dashboard includes memory and CPU utilization tracking per pod, restart pattern analysis, replica count visualization for both deployment versions, and correlation views that help identify relationships between resource consumption and application performance.

This dashboard integrates seamlessly with AI agent queries, enabling natural language access to complex metrics analysis and trend identification. The visualization design emphasizes operational decision-making rather than just data display, making it valuable for both human operators and AI-powered analysis.

### Interactive Operational Scripts (`scripts/`)

The **`scripts/`** directory contains the core automation tools that make this demo interactive and realistic. These scripts serve as the primary interface for hands-on operational exercises and enable realistic testing scenarios that mirror production operational patterns.

#### **Load Testing Framework (`load-test.sh`)**

The **`load-test.sh`** script provides sophisticated load generation capabilities with configurable parameters for duration, concurrency, and CPU burn intensity. This script serves multiple purposes: populating monitoring dashboards with realistic operational data, triggering autoscaling policies for scaling behavior analysis, validating system performance under various load conditions, and creating baseline metrics for AI-powered analysis.

The script accepts three primary parameters enabling flexible testing scenarios:
- **Duration**: Test execution time (default: 120 seconds)
- **Concurrency**: Simultaneous request threads (default: 150)
- **CPU Burn**: Milliseconds of CPU work per request (default: 500ms)

Advanced usage patterns include progressive load testing for capacity discovery, stress testing for breaking point identification, sustained load testing for endurance validation, and baseline testing for performance regression analysis.

#### **Chaos Engineering Framework (`simulate-failure.sh`)**

The **`simulate-failure.sh`** script implements controlled failure injection with two distinct operational modes. The **immediate failure mode** triggers rapid pod deletion to demonstrate Kubernetes self-healing capabilities and recovery time measurement. The **controlled outage mode** provides predictable failure scenarios with configurable duration and automatic recovery, enabling comprehensive failover testing and Mean Time To Recovery analysis.

The script supports both blue and green deployment targeting, configurable outage duration for predictable testing scenarios, graceful recovery with replica restoration, and comprehensive logging for post-incident analysis. This enables realistic chaos engineering practices without requiring complex external tools or infrastructure modifications.

#### **Environment Management (`setup-sre-companion.sh` and `cleanup.sh`)**

The **`setup-sre-companion.sh`** script provides comprehensive environment provisioning with robust error handling, prerequisite validation, and automated service configuration. The script manages Docker runtime selection, Minikube cluster provisioning, comprehensive component deployment, and automatic service access configuration.

The **`cleanup.sh`** script ensures complete environment removal including cluster destruction, context cleanup, and artifact removal, enabling reliable reset capabilities for repeated demonstrations and configuration testing.

### Container Image (`Dockerfile`)

The **`Dockerfile`** implements security and performance best practices for containerized applications. The multi-stage approach uses Python 3.11 slim base images to minimize attack surface while maintaining compatibility. Environment variable configuration enables dynamic behavior modification without requiring image rebuilds, supporting the blue/green deployment pattern through runtime customization.

## Quick Deployment and Configuration

### Prerequisites and Environment Setup

Successful deployment requires Docker, Kubernetes (kubectl), Helm, and Minikube installed with appropriate system resource allocation. The minimum recommended configuration includes 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, and 40GB disk space for complete functionality including AI model operations and comprehensive monitoring.

Configure your Anthropic API key through environment variable export to enable AI-powered operational capabilities:

```bash
# Configure AI model access
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key-here"

# Clone and navigate to project
git clone https://github.com/rsergio07/kagent-sre-companion
cd kagent-sre-companion
```

### Complete System Deployment

Execute the comprehensive setup script for full environment provisioning. The automated deployment typically requires 10-15 minutes depending on network conditions and system performance:

```bash
./scripts/setup-sre-companion.sh
```

This process provisions the Flask demonstration application with blue/green configuration, complete monitoring stack including Prometheus and Grafana with custom dashboards, autonomous failover controller with comprehensive permissions and monitoring logic, and the Kagent AI platform with integrated agent capabilities and model configurations.

## Troubleshooting Common Operational Issues

### **AI Agent Limitations and Workarounds**

**Metrics Access Issues** - If the agent reports inability to access Prometheus metrics, verify RBAC permissions for the kagent service account, MCP server configuration for Prometheus integration, and network connectivity between agent and monitoring services. Use Grafana dashboards as fallback for metrics visualization when AI correlation fails.

**Tool Access Inconsistencies** - The agent may occasionally fail to retrieve specific resources. In such cases, retry queries with more specific parameters, use direct kubectl commands to verify resource existence, and check agent logs for underlying connectivity issues. The agent demonstrates realistic learning patterns by starting with incorrect assumptions and improving through iterative queries.

**Expected Learning Patterns** - The agent may initially check the default namespace before discovering the correct `sre-companion-demo` namespace. This realistic discovery pattern mirrors actual operational troubleshooting workflows and provides educational value about systematic investigation approaches.

### **Script Execution Issues**

**Port Forwarding Connectivity Issues** can often be resolved through process cleanup and session restart without requiring complete system redeployment. Identify conflicting processes using `lsof` commands and terminate as necessary before re-establishing port forwarding sessions.

**Load Test Script Failures** may result from insufficient cluster resources or competing workloads. Monitor resource utilization during tests and adjust concurrency parameters or cluster allocation accordingly.

**Failure Simulation Script Issues** typically indicate RBAC permission problems or invalid deployment targets. Verify that the target deployments exist and that the script has appropriate permissions to scale deployments.

### **Infrastructure and Resource Issues**

**Resource Constraint and Pod Scheduling Issues** typically indicate insufficient Minikube resource allocation or competing workloads consuming available capacity. Address through cluster resource scaling or workload optimization based on actual resource utilization patterns observed through monitoring dashboards.

**Failover Controller Operation Failures** may result from RBAC permission issues, network connectivity problems, or service configuration inconsistencies. Examine controller logs, verify RBAC permissions, and validate service endpoint availability to identify and resolve underlying causes.

## Intentional Limitations and Educational Opportunities

This demonstration deliberately incorporates real-world operational challenges and limitations to provide authentic learning experiences and highlight the importance of human oversight in AI-augmented operations. These intentional constraints serve as valuable teaching moments for understanding the complexities of modern distributed systems management.

**AI Model Integration Constraints** require exact model identifiers and version specifications for proper API integration, demonstrating the importance of infrastructure-as-code practices and version management in operational environments. **API Rate Limiting Challenges** show how external service dependencies can impact operational workflows, emphasizing the need for proper rate limiting strategies, fallback mechanisms, and service degradation planning.

**Observability Gaps and Metrics Collection Limitations** occur through incomplete application instrumentation, resulting in empty Prometheus queries for certain metrics categories. This realistic scenario highlights the critical importance of comprehensive monitoring strategies, instrumentation planning, and observability-driven development practices in production environments.

**Service Configuration Dependencies and Routing Complexities** may cause traffic routing to deployments with zero available pods, creating authentic outage scenarios that demonstrate the value of proper health checking, traffic management policies, and automated recovery mechanisms. **Resource Limit and Scaling Dependencies** can cause AI recommendations to fail when deployments lack proper resource specifications, illustrating the interconnected nature of Kubernetes resource management and autoscaling policies.

**Script-Based Learning Opportunities** include scenarios where load tests may fail due to resource constraints, teaching proper capacity planning and resource management. Failure simulations may not trigger expected behaviors due to probe configurations, demonstrating the importance of proper health check design and testing.

These intentional "failures" provide realistic scenarios for practicing troubleshooting methodologies, understanding distributed systems complexities, and appreciating the nuanced relationship between automated systems and human operational expertise. They demonstrate why AI augments rather than replaces human judgment in critical operational decisions and reinforce the importance of comprehensive system design, monitoring, and operational procedures in modern SRE practices.
